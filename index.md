## Features

nova has many interesting features, including but not limited to:

* [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) out of the box using [classic](https://github.com/rxi/classic)
* Robust data serialization with [binser](https://github.com/bakpakin/binser)
* A scene system (game states) and a service system (can provide hooks to game events and, in turn, additional functionality)
* A simple and very flexible game configuration system with backups and versioning
